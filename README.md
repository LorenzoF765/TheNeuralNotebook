# The Neural Notebook
# Introduction

This is my 2024 Senior Capstone project at Neumont College of Computer Science. It features OpenAI, presented through Django and React. It was developed fully in Python and Java, Python being a new language for me before this project. It was challenging but fruitful, and I am immensely proud of it. I am actively in the process of improving and hosting this publicly, so bare with me.


# Development

As I mentioned, the backend of this project was made through Django, and as such you will need access to your systems command prompt, as well as Virtual Environment to help run everything smoothly, if you choose to use this on your local machine. As for the frontend, you need python installed on your IDE, as well as NPM. Your IDE needs to be able to manage the frontend management, I reccomend Visual Studio Code, as that is what I used.


# Installation

You need an IDE with Python, NPM, and Virtual Environment capabilities. You need open access to your systems command prompt, and you need to be familiar with various paths of your local system.

You also need an IDE capable of coding in Python and JS, as well as CSS if you want to use/change any stylings.
